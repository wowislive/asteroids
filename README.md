# asteroids

Asteroids is my [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project built with Pygame.

A minimalist take on the classic *Asteroids*: you pilot a triangular ship in a wrap-around space, rotate, thrust, and shoot to destroy drifting asteroids. Large rocks split into smaller ones when hit; clear the field to score points while avoiding collisions.
