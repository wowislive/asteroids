# asteroids

Asteroids is my [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project built with Pygame.

A minimalist take on the classic *Asteroids*: you pilot a triangular ship in a wrap-around space, rotate and shoot to destroy drifting asteroids. Large rocks split into smaller ones when hit. Clear the field while avoiding collisions.
